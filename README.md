# Work report up to now
So far, we have completed the training and deployment of six time series models: LSTM, linear regression, ARIMA, random forest, SVM, and GRU, and used them for training and prediction on stock data.
The next step is to add corresponding trading strategies to each model, in order to achieve the goal of backtesting and calculating returns on historical stock data.
